                <h4>Mission:</h4>
				<p>Create product cost comparison calculator that queries a database for the names and cost values of three products and adds that information to a page (use PHP). Please use a set of custom PHP classes to get query data. Then, create a basic layout (use HTML/CSS) that allows a user to:
						<ul>
							<li>modify a quantity value for each product,</li>
							<li>display a sub-total for each product,</li>
							<li>and a grand total for combined products</li>
						</ul>
					(use Javascript/jQuery).</p>
				<h4>Result:</h4>
				<p>I built a small MVC framework, added a products table, wrote a cart script that uses a simple JSON cookie, and bolted on Twitter Bootstrap for the HTML5 template.</p>
				<h4>How it Works:</h4>
				<p>Click 'Add to Cart' from any list screen or product details page. Click the cart button to go to the cart details page, where you can edit the quantities, or drop items from your cart, as requested by above scope.</p>
				<h4>Extra notes:</h4>
				<p>There may be a few UI bugs, but the cart page should fulfill the assignment. I could have expanded and refactored a lot of this. Should make for an interesting conversation piece.</p>
				<p>I did install Magento, but I wanted to build this from scratch, not only to prove what I can create in a short time, but also to illustrate my understanding of important concepts via a small, portable codebase. Plus I wanted to play with Bootstrap, and wrap it into a template. Responsive design is all the rage. Enjoy.</p>
